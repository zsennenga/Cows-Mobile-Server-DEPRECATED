Cows-Mobile-Server
==================

COWS is the COmmunity Web Scheduler used by several UC Davis departments under the College of Engineering Umbrella. 
It interacts with the UC Davis CAS system

Cows-Mobile-Server is a php app used negotiate requests between the Cows web scheduler and moobile client app. 

Essentially this is just an abstraction layer to deal with any future changes to Cows implementations without 
breaking the client app.
